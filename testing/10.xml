 I need to see the site plan for Burnet. Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided. I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy 
of this file. You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct 
amounts and I will input.
