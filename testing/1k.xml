Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

 Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
 According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
 At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
 "What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."
 Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
 Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
 "Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
 At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
 PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
 At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

 Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
 The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
 Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
 "Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning," said one PJM-based trader. "By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up."
 Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
 Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
 In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
 Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

 Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
 The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
 In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
 Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
 Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
 Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
 "The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses," one trader said. "These are much
more realistic prices."
 Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
 Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
 "What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice," one MAPP trader said.
 "Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off," he said, "and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

 Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
 Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
 "There was nothing going on in Florida today," said one
southern energy trader. "Everything was going to markets in the
north."
 Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
 "Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out," said on Entergy power trader. "Prices,
declined to $60 and less."
 The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
 Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
 In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
 "The cold weather's backing off," said one SPP utility
trader. "It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."
 Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

 London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
 The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
 Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
 Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
 December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
 December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
 First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
 January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
 First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
 Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
 Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

 Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
 Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
 Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
 Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
 Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
 "The market's been waiting for this day for a long time," a
Stockholm-based trader said. "For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."
 Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
 The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
 Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
 Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
 Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
 Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
 Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
 Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
 Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues &amp; To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues &amp; to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues &amp; To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group. We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project. It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions. Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&amp;L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems. Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day. 
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta). TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&amp;L in the TDS deal ticker. Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&amp;L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport. Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues &amp; To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues &amp; to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Westgate


Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

 From: Phillip K Allen 09/28/2000 10:56 AM
 


Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1. The high physical prices on the 26th &amp; 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &amp; 
Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and 
 October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?" Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?" Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is 
no point in me following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made? By whom?

 What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

"George Richards" &lt;cbpres@austin.rr.com&gt; on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM
Please respond to &lt;cbpres@austin.rr.com&gt;
To: "Phillip Allen" &lt;pallen@enron.com&gt;
cc: "Larry Lewter" &lt;retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net&gt; 
Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date. 

 Let me know what you think. I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek. I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

 I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which 
I might become involved with Creekside. Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts? Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue? Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's, He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann. 22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's. Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours? He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan. My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex. 

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested. 

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth. I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year. 
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies. There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&amp;P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues. Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
 Local Utilities 

 ( September 05, 2000 ) 


 In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
 Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

 The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
 region's growing number of dot-coms. 

 Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
 on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
 original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
 Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
 house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

 Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
 More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
 HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
 equipment of the Internet economy. 

 It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
 monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

 Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
 sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
 have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
 Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
 facilities. 

 "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
 megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall," 
said Karl
 Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. "That is
 the equivalent of six oil refineries." 

 A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
 data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

 Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
 Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
 tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
 customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
 the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
 Karzmar said. 

 Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
 issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

 For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
 region, this is a new and complex issue. 

 On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
 represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
 day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
 stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
 potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

 Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
 in the area is still open to debate. 

 "These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads," said Bob Royer,
 director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

 "The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
 game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
 center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts." 

 With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
 one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
 square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &amp;
 Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
 six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

 "It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country," boasts Laurent
 Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
 NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
 lease space in the office park. 

 After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
 expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
 development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
 one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

 As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
 such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
 Seattle continues to escalate. 

 But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
 rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
 concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

 Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
 double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
 such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
 have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
 may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

 "We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
 double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
 than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
 Seattle. 

 The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
 industry perplexed. 

 "It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,"
 said Seattle City Light's Royer. "The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
 a way."

We have not received your completed Team Selection information. It is
imperative that we receive your team's information (email, phone number,
office) asap. We cannot start your administration without this information,
and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Phillip. We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address. Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek. 



 




 The following observations can be made:

 July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

 Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
 2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
 3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
 4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

 

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any 
questions.

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial

associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end. 

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. 
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It 
should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. 
=e6-g6.

 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width 
is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
 letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

an email. It is 2:00. I really want to make some progress on these two

is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months. If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper. Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet. This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.

<mail><row>84</row><date>2000/08/21</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>mac.d.hargrove@rssmb.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations:

 Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
 
 Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

 Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

 Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
 (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude 10

 Total 81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model. Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works. I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions. The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results. Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

 1. No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
 2. Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
 3. Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
 4. No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items. I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD. They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000. Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point. Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus. 
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste. I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes. Also, would you be interested in the new class? Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th. We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested. Please let me know. 

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review. If 
you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks.

Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in 
this mandated training program. It is ENA's goal to have all its officers 
through the program before the end of calendar year 2000. The course has 
received very high marks for effectiveness. Please take time now to enroll 
in the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help getting 
signed up.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!! If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so. It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. 

Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Subject: gas storage model


Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well. The Enron Research storage model is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Dear Phillip,

Frogger is leaving shockwave.com soon...

Save it to your Shockmachine now! 

Every frog has his day - games, too. Frogger had a great run as an 
arcade classic, but it is leaving the shockwave.com pond soon. The 
good news is that you can download it to your Shockmachine and 
own it forever! 

Don't know about Shockmachine? You can download Shockmachine for free 
and save all of your downloadable favorites to play off-line, 
full-screen, whenever you want. 

Download Frogger by noon, PST on June 30th, while it's still on 
the site!

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company. I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. 
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk. This is my best guess. I will get back to you with more.

 I want to speak to Wade myself. He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him. 
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office. Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays? I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit. The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual" 
generation. You are pulling "scheduled." If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the "scheduled" number. The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished. I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday. This might be 
more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments.
We can adjust office hours on another day.

 I will respond to the offer on Monday. There is a $35 Million expansion

I was glad to hear from you. I hope we can put the past behind us. Sounds 
like you have been busy. Congratulations on the new baby. Judging from your 
email all is well with you. That's great. 

We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace). Three is it for us. 
What's your target? The other two are doing well. Soccer, T-ball, and bike 
riding keeps them busy. They could use some of Cole's coordination.

My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now. I am just on 
maintenance. You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical 
cyclist. We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months. 
He never misses, rain or shine. Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial 
Park on Saturdays. Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the 
road. I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.

I would like to hear more about your new job. Maybe we could grab lunch 
sometime.

Subject: Transport p&amp;l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&amp;l that looks strange 
to me. Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&amp;E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019. 
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&amp;l--not change your 
overall p&amp;l.) Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&amp;l impacts of each.
 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin ($182,030)
 139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora ($ 4,024)
 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin ($ 8,271)
 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin ($ 38,705)
 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield ($ 1,988)
 Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. 
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it. The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&amp;L associated with each.

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140. I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months. 6 month payout would be $190/month. 
12 month payout would be $95/month. Your choice. I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so. Does $10/hr sound 
fair? We can apply it to the loan.

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal ) for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500 SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Subject: Re: SW Gas 

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning. They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities. We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Subject: SW Gas

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong &amp; Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. 
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are 
typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? 
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are 
there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Thanks for remembering my birthday. You beat my parents by one day. 

The family is doing fine. Grace is really smiling. She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast. I think my folks are ready 
to start building. 

We will probably visit in late June or July. May is busy. We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 &amp; #3. He agreed that it 
would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to 
#2. Then they can just focus on #19. I worked on the books this weekend but

Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&amp;l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&amp;l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&amp;l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally. Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles. A valve 
adjustment might do some good. It has idled very high
for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week. Great job on February.

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12. The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork. However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

&gt;I find it almost impossible to put down

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ? My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book "The Roman Pantheon" at $25.00 - a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation. Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy. Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this. Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis. If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks. 

Keep Pedalling - Lee

 The numbers for January are below:

 Actual flows X gas daily spreads $ 463,000
 Actual flow X Index spreads $ 543,000
 Jan. value from original bid $1,750,000
 Estimated cost to unwind hedges ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000. I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso. Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry. The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back. I am considering the
following features: stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs. I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country. Can you help?

&gt; We recently faced the same questions concerning our cement floor finishing
&gt; here's what we found.
&gt;
&gt; Oringinal Plan: was for stamped and pigmented (color added at the cement
plant)
&gt; with stained accents and highlighting to simulate a sautillo tile. Our
project
&gt; is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.
Lot's
&gt; of cement approx. 160 sq yds. After looking at the costs we changed our
minds
&gt; rather quickly.
&gt;
&gt; Labor for Stamping Crew $2500.00
&gt; Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x $18 lb $7200.00
&gt;
&gt; These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.
&gt;
&gt; Actual Result: Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo
tiles
&gt; for inside the house. Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb
per yd
&gt; mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the
porch
&gt; and accented with acid etched stain.
&gt;
&gt; Tiles and Transportation $3000.00
&gt; Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting (did it myself) $1400.00
&gt; Acid Stain for porch $ 350.00
&gt; Davis Pigment $15 x 40 yds $ 600.00
&gt;
&gt; I can get you the info on the stain if you like, I ordered it from a
company the
&gt; web, can't remember off hand who. I ordered a sample kit for $35.00 which
has 7
&gt; colors you can mix and match for the results you want. It was easy to work
with
&gt; much like painting in water colors on a large scale.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps you out,
&gt;

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October. He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category. I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Call me with questions.(x37041)

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

 Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
 At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
 "Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline," said one Southwest trader.
 According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
 At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
 Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
 At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
 According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
 "We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop," said one Northwest trader.
 At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
 According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

 Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
 According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
 In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
 "There's just no weather out there," said one PJM-based
trader. "There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long."
 Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
 Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
 Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
 The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
 Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

 Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
 "It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there," one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
"Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that."
 The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
 Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
 Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
 "Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices," an
ECAR trader said.
 In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
 Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
 Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
 For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
 Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
 "There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too," one MAPP trader said.
"It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

 Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
 Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
 Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
 The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
 On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
 In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
 "There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have," said one Texas-based utility power trader.
"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."
 On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
 Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
 Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
 In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
 On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

 London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
 Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
 The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
 Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
 June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
 On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
 Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

 Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
 Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
 "The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. "I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
 Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a "more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
 Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a "high'' spot price for this time of the year.
 Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
 Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

groups.

WHEN: Friday, May 18
TIME: 10:00 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided
WHERE: Enron Building, 8C1 (8th floor)

A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the 
London office and a teleconference will be set up for others who would like 
to call in.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term. We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Please RSVP as soon as possible and let us know if you plan to participate in

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into 
the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. 
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this 
concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. 
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders: JP Morgan $2.5 B
 Lehman Brothers $1.0 B
 Bear Stearns $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate 5.77%
 Tax-Exempt Rate 4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR: 5.38%
Maturity Date: August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations. Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid 
for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for 
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can 
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format. 

My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Just wanted to give you an update. I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings. At the same time I am pursuing FHA

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated. During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE: Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE: At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN). There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type: 
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER. You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below. Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK. You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE: There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients. You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook. Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

- Tasks
- Journal
- Spell Checker
- Offline Use
- Printing Templates
- Reminders
- Timed Delivery
- Expiration
- Outlook Rules
- Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
- Sharing Contacts with others
- Task Delegation
- Direct Resource Booking
- Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the 
year. Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA. 

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA. Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?

California. This subject has already gotten so much press.

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz. He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May. It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected. The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary. Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor. According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region. Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him. I believe 
he has sent you my plans. They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects. 

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor? If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time. I am excited about potentially using your product.

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value. The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. Please call or email 
with comments.

Phillip Allen

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed 

Phil, I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors "in smoke filled rooms", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers. Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda. Hope this info helps. Ray

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting? 
Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed

Here is a photograph of a similar house. The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area. In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front. A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side. The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the 
front porch. 

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow 
and fax you a copy.

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up. I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on why prices are so high in 
California. This subject has already gotten so much press.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position. Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter. Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset. If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday. I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system. I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you. In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations. The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered. 
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale. I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen</body></mail>

It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents. 
There is one item of which I was unsure. Was an environmental
report prepared before the original purchase? If yes, shouldn't it be listed 
as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?

Thank you for your bid. I have decided on a floor plan. I am going to have 
an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed 
specification list. I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when 
complete for a final bid. Probably in early to mid June.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West. Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts). Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. 
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish). This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. 
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I 
hope this helps. Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.

The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday 
April 20th. If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful. If 
you have made other commitments I understand.

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th. However, my closing has been postponed. As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George &amp; Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering). I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the 
sellers to be executed.

Phillip

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter. Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity. I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.

the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft. He took my plan and 
improved it. I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans. While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th. Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day? Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060 with any questions. 

(You must enter &amp; exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell &amp; Smith.)

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save. My only questions are:

1. Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01. Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
 of the two week period. What is going on?

2. Gilbert in #27-is he just late? 


Here is a file for 12/08.</body></mail>

I am out of the office for the rest of the week. Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks? I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday. Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

<mail><row>366</row><date>2001/03/29</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>rlehmann@yahoo.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans? 

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows:

 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
 2%- overhead
 4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about 
such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

<mail><row>372</row><date>2001/03/28</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>rlehmann@yahoo.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron. Only about 5 feet.

9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2.

12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron 
railings?

15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect? They have both sent me agreements. The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership. 

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me. Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who 
receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses. After debt service that would only leave $122K. The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course). He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period. His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week. He still 
wants to receive this payment.

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen &amp; baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans. The dimensions may be to small to read. 
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'. For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage. 

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design? It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line. Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you. Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project". Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. 

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro &amp; Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,"
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

 By Jessica Berthold
 Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

 AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,"
Thomas said. "It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

 Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. "We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited."
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

if we want to try and complete the project in phases. Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning. He was contracted to complete the

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project. It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses. The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions. You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land. I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment. My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

 Subject: Denver trading

I would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the 
Eastern Rockies trading region. The plan is for Susan to work with me in 
moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston. Her 
specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and 
Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.

Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara. She is also working 
on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different 
trading points from Opal to the mid-continent.

My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 
22 - April 24). I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during 
bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time. I will 
probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with 
us and the logistics team, maybe in early May. Then, Susan and I will both 
go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to 
complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.

We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding 
reservations.

Thank you,

Jay

I realize you are disappointed about the project. It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses. The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions. You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land. I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment. My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the 
closing statement or on some other document.

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. 
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean. What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent. Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40. If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation. When do you need it? You can 
use me as a reference. In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is 
still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed. 

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that. 

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He 
wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. 

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market. 

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? 
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal. Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load. Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&amp;E forecast sheets. Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

What is the outstanding balance on #1. It looks like 190 + 110(this week)=

Have a good weekend. I will talk to you next week.

In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy

Subject: Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project. Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction. First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1. Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

 Pro-Forma Bank's Adjustment
 Unit Unit Rent Rent/BR Unit Rent Rent/BR
 2 BR/2.5 BA $1,150 $575 $950 $475
 3 BR/Unit $1,530 $510 $1,250 $417

2. Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3. A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4. Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5. The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6. Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

 Land - $1,121,670

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates. As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA. I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with. 
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order. I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date. Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda. Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you. Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have
the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my
concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million. The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &amp;
 builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million

 Land 1.15

 Interim Financing .85

 Common Areas .80

 Total $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2 Has she actually paid the $150 deposit. Her move in date was 2/6. It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9 Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15 Since he has been such a good tenant for so long. Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33 Missed rent. Are they still there?

#26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. 
Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week. If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com. Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues. If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation. Any day between 
March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your 
time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough. The 
items I listed moved dramatically. Also, some of the questions were just 
clarification of what was in a number. 

Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1. First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith? I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2. Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%. The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal. Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC. This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3. The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit. Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Andrew Ozuna

There have been some updates to the cost. The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional. Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased. I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&amp;N
total of rentable units. Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities. I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement. They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different. Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject. It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect. I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation. They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing. We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go. An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week. I will be checking my
messages.

There have been some updates to the cost. The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional. Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased. I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&amp;N
total of rentable units. Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities. I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
 parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
 scheduling in Unify are grey.

2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further scrutiny.

3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at 
everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
 some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&amp;2/9 of $110. I can't tell if he still

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95. Hopefully, he won't have a

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of "construction management" 
fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? 
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Here is the 2/2 rentroll. The total does not equal the bank deposit. Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to. If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday. I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll. Let's get this stuff clean today.

 Here is a rentroll for this week. The one you sent for 11/24 looked good. 
It seems like most people are paying on time. Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income? Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units. If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday. I will talk to you on Friday.

I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on 
January 2nd versus February 11:

 1/2 2/11

Stanfield to Malin 209 81

SJ/Perm. to Socal 896 251

Sj to Socal 2747 768

PGE/Top to Citygate 51 3

PGE/Top to KRS 16 4

SJ to Valero 916 927


If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value 
since the beginning of the year. Can you confirm that I am looking at the 
right numbers?

Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years. The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price. There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party. We are definitely being considered as that party. 
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further. If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis. Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand. Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps. I wrote it as if it were from you. It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. 

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out. You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators. We have to get this done next week. I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers. The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records. Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office. Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626. He will know what I 
mean.

Talk to you later,

I am sending the Dr. a contract for Monday delivery. He is offering
$739,000 with $73,900 down.

He wants us to finish the work on the units that are being renovated now.
We need to specify those units in the contract. We also need to specify the
units that have not been remodeled. I think he will be a good buyer. He is
a local with plenty of cash. Call me after you get this message.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4. #11 Missed on 2/2?

5. #13 Missed on 1/26?

6. #14 missed on 2/2?

7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8. #20a missed on 2/2?

9. #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. 
You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on 
some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him. Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer. Did you meet 
them? If so, what did you think?

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? 

The key business points are:

1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5. 60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements. The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash. 

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.


Phillip</body></mail>
<mail><row>490</row><date>2001/02/06</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>jsmith@austintx.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns. 

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the 
property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call me later today.

Phillip

When we meet, I would like to address the following issues:

1.) I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.) It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.) It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&amp;l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00, but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets. (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.) (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter, who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the "Rent Due" column. The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is 
going on?

#25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. 

Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. 

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time. We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

#25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. 

Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. 

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time. We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

As you might be aware, Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday in order to calc my book. While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon, I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level. I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue. Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. 

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would 
like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3. Considering #1 &amp; #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price 705,000

1st Lien 473,500

2nd Lien 225,000

Transfer fee 7,500

Cash required 14,500


NOI 100,000

1st Lien 47,292

2nd Lien 23,694

Cash flow 29,014

Cash on cash 200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider? Let me know.

Phillip

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs 383
Total $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.
A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20

That is good news about Leander. 

Now for the stage. I would like to get it sold by the end of March. I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. 

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. 
However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property. My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly. I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on. 

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday. 


Phillip

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract. 

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
 +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
 -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs &amp; Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent. One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off. 

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter. They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close. Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs &amp; Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE; Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal. Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete. PG&amp;E is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&amp;E would "retain" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&amp;E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&amp;E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&amp;E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&amp;E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this. No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together. 
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill . Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


 

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately. While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event. We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed. I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above). We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon. We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session. Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date. In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer. Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

 


Thank you,
Jana

#32 and #29 are fine. 

#28 paid weekly on 1/5. Then he switched to biweekly. He should have paid 
260 on 1/12. Two weeks rent in advance. Instead he paid 260 on 1/19. He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks. He is only paid one week in advance. This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll. Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

Everything is short and sweet except the caption! One comment. The very

I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project. They need 
the following:

Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.
Builders resume listing similar projects

The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday. If we are 
interested in his loan, he would want to come see the site.
If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along. You can 
send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).

The broker is Jim Murnan. His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call 
him and send the documents to him directly.

It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership 
agreement. I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon 
as possible. 

Please email or call with an update.

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson, 
a trader. "It makes the market for natural gas." 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting," McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

"I was getting worried," he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It's time to consider 
some changes."

Why did so many tenants not pay this week?

#12 95
#21 240
#27 120
#28 260
#33 260

Total 975

It seems these apartments just missed rent. What is up?

Other questions:

#9-Why didn't they pay anything? By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent 
should have been due on 12/12 of $220.

#3-Why did they short pay?

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs. Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle. WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs. Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms. ($3.5B by end of 
April). Pat Boylston will develop "public benefit" language for options 
working with Mike Day. He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen). Explain the 
magnitude of the problem. Get Mike Day to help draft language. 

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths. Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible. These people should update their respective business units.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser. Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom. Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract. 

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
 +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
 -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. There 
are alot of overages. It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. 
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap. I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

<mail><row>552</row><date>2001/01/04</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>gallen@thermon.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other 
for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! 
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this 
right? Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA. In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. 
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview: We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW). He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals: I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided). He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. 
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas: The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". 
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.

Larry,

I was able to scan my 98 &amp; 99 tax returns into Adobe. Here they are plus the 
excel file is a net worth statement. If you have any trouble downloading or 
printing these files let me know and I can fax them to you. Let's talk 
later today.

P.S. Please remember to get Jim Murnan the info. he needs.

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing. Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston. I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you. Can you please send it to him. His contact information is: phone 
(713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document. He 
was positive about his experience overall. He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.

Phillip</body></mail>
<mail><row>560</row><date>2000/12/27</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>jim123@pdq.net</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Jim,

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the 
equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need. The land is scheduled to close mid January.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility 
connections? Other rezoning costs? 

What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

<mail><row>563</row><date>2000/12/22</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>steven.kean@enron.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
 replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
 This creates a shortage in later months.

 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. 
 Specific questions should include: 

 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system. 
 I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
 LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market 
and the 
 consumer has benefitted. 


Call me if you need any more input.

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated. 
 
 The critical information is 1. Move in or lease start date
 2. Lease expiration date
 3. Rent
 4. Deposit 
 
 If you have the info you can
 fill in these items 1. Number of occupants
 2. Workplace
 

 All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
 

 I really need to get this by tomorrow. Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants. And email it to me 
tomorrow. You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications. 

Phillip</body></mail>
<mail><row>577</row><date>2000/12/14</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>stagecoachmama@hotmail.com</to><subj/><cc/><bcc/><body>Lucy,

Here is a new file for 12/15.




For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:

 #23 &amp; #24 did not pay. Just late or moving?

 #25 &amp; #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08. What is the deal?

 #11 Looks like she is caught up. When is she due again?


Please email the answers.

Phillip

Subject: Re: 

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the "socalprices" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $? If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from? I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

As noted in my last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date. My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman. Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000 $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001 $ 669,600
February 2001 $ 604,800
March 2001 $ 669,600
April 2001 $ 648,000
May 2001 $ 669,600
June 2001 $ 648,000
July 2001 $ 669,600
August 2001 $ 669,600
September 2001 $ 648,000
October 2001 $ 669,600
November 2001 $ 648,000
December 2001 $ 669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk. The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01). The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test 
server environment on Tuesday. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

best regards

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace &gt;40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate. We applied forward gas prices to historical loads. I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year. 
Prices seem low. Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices. What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

 Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities. I am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave. She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time. She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports. Patti worked 7 days a week during this time. 
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti. 
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist. Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR. Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?" Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award. Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave. Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time. Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time. Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package. All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided. This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions. 
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Phillip,

&gt; As discussed during our phone conversation, In a Parallon 75 microturbine
&gt; power generation deal for a national accounts customer, I am developing a
&gt; proposal to sell power to customer at fixed or collar/floor price. To do
&gt; so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an
&gt; onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity
&gt; on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your
&gt; best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for
&gt; annual/seasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for
&gt; customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh 's using
&gt; microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited/
&gt; no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy
&gt; gas trading, truly you.
&gt;
&gt; We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of
&gt; stores (60-100) in San Diego.
&gt; Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent.
&gt;
&gt; For 6-8 hours a day Microturbine run time:
&gt; Gas requirement for 180 microturbines 227 - 302 MMcf per year
&gt; Gas requirement for 240 microturbines 302 - 403 MMcf per year
&gt;
&gt; Gas will likely be consumed from May through September, during peak
&gt; electric period.
&gt; Gas price required: Burnertip price behind (LDC) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric
&gt; Need detail breakout of commodity and transport cost (firm or
&gt; interruptible).
&gt;
&gt; Should you have additional questions, give me a call.
&gt; Let me assure you, this is real deal!!

I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and 
possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to 
your efforts. Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I 
want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with. I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.

For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re: Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago. After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category. Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement 
with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and 
today American Express has surfaced. Consequently, I think it's probably a 
good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you. 

I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work? If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th. When would be good for you? Please 
let me know!

Thank you,

Jeff

If you are currently accessing the EOL database via Excel, Access or any

EOL intends to stop access to the data within the next month. This means that 
any spreadsheets or Access databases will not function subsequent to this

We are currently working with EOL to attain a solution, and need your help to 
build an inventory of all potential problems.

Thanks for the inquiry. I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up. 
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job. As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top. If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview. He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here. He is very valuable to me and ENA. Please let me 
know.

bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. 

Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in

John,
Is there a man by the name of Henry (Dutch) Quigley who will be working in 
your group? His name was not on the list I sent to you previously,
but he showed up on another list from HR as being assigned to your group. 
Please let me know and I will make any necessary adjustments

This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS 
with. In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend 
projections, he had the "Professional Services" highlighted with a bunch of 
question marks. It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ 
$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day. Either way, 
it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works). I'll be going 
over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys. I'll 
keep you posted.

Clarification on the below.

Point #1 our position has been $3MM on software (they are saying they need 
$4MM to get the deal done.)

Additionally, they want Maintenance and professional services to go with the 
dollar amount. $2.4MM is their position here. I need your help to clarify 
with each group who is on board with maintenance and profesional services. 
BMC's #2 guy Jeff Hawn told Jim Crowder this was critical for them.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal. We are making real progress. 
Here are the answers to your questions:

1. How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue? 
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2. Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years? 
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3. Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron? 
Not sure what you mean here
4. Your note re: getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions. I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

 Subject: BMC Update

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys. Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract. EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron). Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point. 

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel. In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles: 
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc. In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls &amp; messages to all of them: 
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith. I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm. Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them: how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue? Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years? Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron? Your 
note re: getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions. Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday! I'll be here next week.

Caroline

Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

PS I am coming back on the 6th. Once I finish up the week, I am off to Berlin 
for New Year's Eve and then a little trip over to Prague.

Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard &amp; Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be "substantial." In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"
Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey
said.

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles. Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. 
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. 

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change. Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience. If you need my assistance with this please let me know. I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions. Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Sarah-Joy...
I just picked up your voice mail...

I am forwarding Byron Gaddis's e-mail in response to your question of who
PCC is working with at EES.

Let me stress that I am not working with anyone other than John (and now
hopefully you) at Enron to get PCC Ball Valves approved for international
use at Enron.

I am providing Byron Gaddis' e-mail address as he is in Portland at Corp HQ=
,
and is familiar with the issue. He may be able to provide a name for you at
EES that PCC is working to conclude an agreement on energy....note that the
activity is covered under a Conf Agreement to protect PCC and its data. In
addition, Byron was curious about your possible need for blades and the
mechanism you go through to acquire them.

As for me... we would like you to fall in love with our world class ball
valves from PCC Ball Valves (hence putting them on the approved supplier
list) AND also love our Emergency Shutdown Systems for pipelines by our
Barber Industries (again, feeling so smitten that they find their way onto
your approved list)... John has the information packages on both companies
and product lines...

For me... signing off from Milan Italy...where I have been living and
breathing these ball valves this week. Shipments of 40" and 48" units going
to Transgaz on a Romanian/ Russian pipeline as well as 36" units for a
Turkish pipeline are going out....

As of today, Richard Roberts, FedEx Senior Attorney, notified me of the
following:

Billy Mike Golden, Managing Director of Field Facility Management,
received a call from John Patillo. Mr. Golden was in the process of
returning his call at approximately 2:15 p.m. Depending on what the
two discussed will determine if FedEx needs to hold a conference call to
discuss this further.

If a conference call is needed, it will occur as soon as possible. The
attendees will be FedEx employees. They are as follows:

Carmen Perez, Corporate Account Executive
Billy M. Golden
Gary Stoops, Managing Director of Supply Chain Management
Richard Roberts

After FedEx holds the conference call, it will be determined if FedEx
commercial and legal needs to meet with Enron commercial and legal.

I understand if resolution does not take place prior to December 31,
2000 FedEx may not be Enron's carrier.

Regards,

Carmen Perez

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces. 
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto. John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS. EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one. I 
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to 
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe. When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's 
retraction. It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very 
"customer-focused" on BMC's part. I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to 
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Not that it matters but wanted you to know:
BMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 % 
discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time. He states now 
that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later 
date.

Importance: High

Jenny/Bob

Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing:

TidalSoft, Sysadmiral
Approx. 90 k ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) 
We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k 
worst case. This quote covers consulting and maintenance. They are trying 
very hard to get a deal done this year and we could probably get our 
additional components at the current quote price if we signed. 

BMC, Control -M
Approx. 325 k This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from 
the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for 
a total of 628 k

Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. 

We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take 
over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long 
term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP 
modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors 
into BMC. We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft 
(Larry if you have info on this please comment).

Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning 
towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable. You 
guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it 
will lend to the EBS/BMC deal. FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% 
discount if we cut the SAP modules. BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn 
how over priced their products are !

Let me know what you think. If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through 
or be advised to let it go till the New Year.

Thanks
Bruce


*****
Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :
BMC, Control SA
1.3 M NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME - Is a candidate for future 
consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate 
as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS. I guess they put 
this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno

Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces. 
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto. John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS. EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in

 Subject: HP -- confidential internal document

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. 
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and 
wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) 

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points: 

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person. 


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron. He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 &lt;&lt;RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.&gt;&gt;

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday). I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it. Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left. I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity, Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides. I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.
Thanks,

 Michael,

 I left you a voice message today regarding Enron. I'm doing
a presentation and I would like to get the amount ($) of contracts we
currently have with Enron Services. For example the $97M 5-year contract for
power. I understand that we have contracts in the Northeast and West for
facilities.

 Can you provide me with that kind of data? I would
appreciate it.

 My presentation is on the 14th of December.

 Any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

 Michael,
 Thanks for the update. I am OK with your decision
not to select Enron (and I also reviewed with Jim Milton). Given that Enron
chose not to rebid, I certainly think this is a reasonable decision.

 It is very important that I (and the Enron account
team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us
in the loop.

 Regards,
 Jerry

 Jerry,

 As part of our continuing communication with
the Compaq/Enron account team, below is an overview of a recent bid
analysis for services at Compaq's Novi, MI site. Enron Building Services
is the current service provider for Office Services related support. The
proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the
price provided by Enron. Enron has been given the opportunity to revise
their pricing but has chose not to. The recommendation is to award the
business to Pitney Bowes. Please confirm that you concur with our
recommendation. Thanks.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
 Background: Enron Building Services was
providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help
desk support for Compaq's Novi, MI site. Compaq recently chose to hire the
facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee. Enron Building Services
provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.
The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by
Pitney Bowes. The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing
is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.
They have opted not to lower the price. The recommendation of both Real
Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.


 Enron Building Services Current Cost:

 Base cost for services was
$190,198.00
 Admin/Help Desk
$44,787.00
 Ship/Rec
$35,521.00
 Receptionist
$38,610.00
 Facilities Manager
$71,280.00
 Mail Van/Car (remote site
support) $13,030.00
 Management Fee
$14,210.00
 Total Cost
$216,438.00

 Compaq hired the facility manager as a
badged employee.

 Enron Building Services Proposed Cost:

 Base cost for remaining services
$128,071.00
 Admin/Help Desk
$53,940.00
 Ship/Rec
$35,521.00
 Receptionist
$38,610.00
 Mail Van/Car (deleted)
 Management Fee
$8,324.00
 Total Cost
$136,395.00


 Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk
cost.

 Pitney Bowes has submitted a proposal to
provide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total
cost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.

I agree. Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about 
this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd 
definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall 
commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply 
in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with 
HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless 
decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, 
and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably 
linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more 
recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg 
understand that his focus was different than ours. 

Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have 
certainly found her involvement invaluable.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. 
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and 
wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) 

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points: 

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person. 


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

Hello Curtis,

sorry for the late response.
An upgrade from E1 to E3 is not an option for the mentioned locations, for
the foreseeable future.
The 2. proposal is also not an option for us, because we buy bandwidth on
demand and the demands change very dynamically, therefore such a plan would
not fit our requirements.

best regards Dietmar

Dietmar,
 Attached is a message from Enron Broadband Services on sizing the
proposal back to SAP.
Hopefully his attached message is clear in terms of finding a way to
structure it
for growth based on your needs. This would increase the size of our
arrangement if it
makes good sense for you. Please get back to me with your thoughts.

Curtis - following our phone call this morning I met with Matt Harris and
our
structuring person (Glenn Surowiec) to review the deal. After some quick
analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.

The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.
The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.

Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).

For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

Please let me know what your thoughts are and let's talk ASAP.

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - Quest is so far ahead 
technology-wise and cheaper.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate. I believe Jim 
Ogg wants to evaluate more tools and related design tools before making a 
decision.

Here's the latest, in a nutshell. Basically, the testing is not fully 
completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision). As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out 
on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas. 
However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.

In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS. The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation. 

Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point. I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th. Jennifer or I will keep 
you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.

I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to 
me. The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question: more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done. The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's 
solution is a better one for us.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent 
product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase. I believe 
Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G. I had the agenda discussion items and guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
"message" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides. 

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call. Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: FW: Fedex and other cross sells UPDATE



Jennifer:

In my absence, the only issues I expect to arise are the Fedex and HP deals.

For FEDEX: (cross sell) I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, 
Carmen Perez's boss's boss this morning at his office in Chicago. 
847-215-4241. This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex 
business units which I have received.

(buy side--John Will) I forwarded John's latest update earlier this week 
then his note below. First, he had several conference calls with George 
Wasaff to John Pattillo. John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John 
on Friday (he didn't) with the specifics of ABS' counter offer to FEDEX. 
John's e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back 
from Pattillo. Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex 
account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex's 
response to lawsuit issue update. Third, George Wasaff has made himself 
available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will 
help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor. Fourth, John has been told to 
begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual 
relationship. I've asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments 
with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex 
account.

HP: Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine. Peter G. has asked 
Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron 
wireless team returns from London. This is in progress. EFS/Datawarehouse 
equipment meeting set for early Jan. Spoke with Peter G.

I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the 
opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert 
with the sales force. My e-mailed question to you was as follows: Do we 
just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter 
G. message delivered to him on 12/14?


Kinko's: Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko's CIO via conference call. That 
enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko's. Also, connected Ed 
Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing. He is the initial decision 
maker. Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of 
Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from 
EIM Pulp &amp; Paper team 9 months ago. But, the offer was not as competitive as 
the options offered by the Kinko's paper mills. Ed and Chris have some 
homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing. 
Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau 
on getting to the CFO's office as necessary. So, both sides are moving 
foward here.

Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F. on office automation 
(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn't attend the 
meeting. Ed had some great ideas for the process.


Continental: Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 
PM as a follow up thank-you. Meeting minutes sent out. Will be working with 
Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for 
airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going. Also, followup up with Tawney, 
Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan. Plastics will also be coming to 
GSS/BD to give educational overview.

CSC, Sonoco, Instromet followup in Jan. 2001.

Have a great holiday! I will be checking my work voicemail daily weekdays 
(except Christmas day).

 Subject: Compaq Update


 


Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq. Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners. During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named). My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections. EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets. 
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services. For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters. EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th. Compaq has not paid the 
invoice. Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq. Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay. Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position). 
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount. 
 Compaq (Bob Jordan) value - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
 EBS (added) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
 EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
 Compaq total is $5.1 million spend at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
 EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income. Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002. If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount. To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq. Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million). This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee. It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M). This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million. This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction. So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship. 

 So...... please let me know your thougths. We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000. 

Please let me know your thoughts

In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting. We would 
appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.

Background:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year 
with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic 
Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader, to review the strong 
business relationship in fuel management and travel services which Enron has 
had with Continental Airlines. Discussions were held as to how this 
relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.

A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both 
companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to 
expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in 
weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

December 11th Meeting Purpose: Follow-up from October 25th meeting to 
specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th 
meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude: (1) fuel management, 
(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.

Location: Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his 
availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor. If he can make it for 
a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he 
is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 
Smith Street. Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific 
preference?

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, 
we have coordinated through John Nowlan. At the October 25th meeting, Alan 
Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather 
derivatives opportunities, respectively. 

Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines Enron's 
current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed 
initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging. Larry 
Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing 
input on this.

Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer. Any news on this? 

I spoke to John briefly this morning. Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week. John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS. I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP. My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon. Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary

Good Morning!

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer. Any news on this? 

Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.


Appreciate it.

Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week. It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO. I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed. One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies. I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send. At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up. I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

 Happy Holidays,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS 
relationship. EBS has identified potential server business opportunities 
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together. 
After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin 
as the point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from 
Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith 
McAuliffe or Kent Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending 
additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business 
opportunities and issues. 

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions. EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions. To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship. 

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice 
amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000. 
2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, 
Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). 
The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. 
EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal. 

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship. In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details. Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication. 

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement. I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history. During the meetings in 
August 2000, EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended. There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq). Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services. Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon. A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October. EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections. This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November. EBS has not heard anything regarding the language. 
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000. The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services. This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000). 

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

Kim,

Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave
Spurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.
All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life
easier.

Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My
reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron
and Compaq. We are both exposed to potential unnecessary pitfalls that are
clearly evident in the original agreement.

We look forward to resolving this issue, amending this agreement, and moving
forward in the partnership between Enron and Compaq.

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS
relationship. EBS has identified potential server business opportunities
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.
After
our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the
point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from Compaq
to
direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or
Kent
Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time
with
David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and
issues.

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop
the
streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting
that
there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server
Supply
Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions. EBS and
Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product
and
Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions. To that end, EBS has
had
internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our
relationship.

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework
for
our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until those
changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq
was
invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,
2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice
amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section
3.0 on
or before December 31,2000.
2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,
Compaq
(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). The
understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice
and
payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a new
contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. EBS
strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq
believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look
forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Please find the following EMail as a piece of the EBS / Compaq history. 
This is the amendment language developed to address the five clarification 
points rasied during the EBS / Compaq meetings in August and September 
2000. These meetings were held to gain mutual understanding and clearly 
identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement. 

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning. I look forward to resolution of these perspectives. 

thanks,

Kim

British Trader Sentenced to Prison=20

 The court was told that Humphries' trading losses began o=

 The situation worsened at 1:30 p.m., when U.S. economic=

I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with 
Jennifer Medcalf. 

During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during 
their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have 
attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has 
with regard to selection/use of BMC's products. Bernie voiced that he hasn't 
been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net 
Works has, beyond what you and I know. The BMC account team feels that 
without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.

The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing). Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't 
kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general. Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.

You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification 
and liquidated damages clauses being implemented. Jennifer and I discussed 
this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context. We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider: perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.

For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC. A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to "click" might be this: EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC. That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future). In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now. I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.

If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.

Thanks,

Jeff

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&amp;l minus new deal p&amp;l since June 1. Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates. I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&amp;l volatility.

Subject: Re Larry May - REVISED


John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR. It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's. (the code is "NG-OPT-XL-PRC")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million. This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th. The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&amp;L is never close to that. Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second: Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer. some examples are strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
 weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just subscribe to a weather 
service
 storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
 production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad commission 
reports)
 end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage. 
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group. Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates. It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis). As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

 INPUTS OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension
S1 &gt;220 -0.01 n/a F
S2 &lt;30 +0.01 n/a F
S3 &lt;10 +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension
V1 &lt;4 n/a -0.01 F
V2 &gt;3 n/a +0.01 F
V3 &gt;5 +0.01 +0.02 F
V4 &gt;10 +0.02 +0.04 F
V5 &gt;15 +0.04 +0.15 F
V6 &gt;20 n/a n/a T
 
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather 
up
front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit
whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left.
 i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in 
march-they
gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em
strong so long as they stay way below ratchets. other thing worries me about

and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a

<mail><row>753</row><date>2000/12/12</date><from>russell.dyk@enron.com</from><to>john.arnold@enron.com</to><subj>LNG to California</subj><cc>jennifer.fraser@enron.com</cc><bcc>jennifer.fraser@enron.com</bcc><body>John,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&amp;E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day) Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000 7.4 100,000 8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000 1.64 100,000 8.2
Sacramento 57,600 4.72 132,000 10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon 60,000 4.92 
Evanston, WY Amoco 95,000 7.8 100,000 8.2

Totals 26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. </body></mail>

&gt;Suspended Rabbi Quits Seminary Presidency
&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/07/national/07RABB.html
&gt;
&gt;December 7, 2000
&gt;
&gt;By GUSTAV NIEBUHR
&gt;
&gt;Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, a leading figure in Judaism's Reform
&gt;movement as president of its seminary, has resigned from his job
&gt;after being suspended by the movement's rabbinic organization for
&gt;having entered into "personal relationships" in the past that the
&gt;organization said violated its ethical code.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
&gt;Institute of Learning, where he had been considered a charismatic
&gt;and innovative leader, quit that post on Monday, after the Central
&gt;Conference of American Rabbis suspended his rabbinical functions
&gt;for at least two years, college and conference officials said.
&gt;
&gt; In a statement, the college said the suspension followed an
&gt;investigation by the conference into "personal relationships" of
&gt;Rabbi Zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that
&gt;they predated his appointment as president in January 1996. Rabbi
&gt;Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was
&gt;founded in 1875.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,
&gt;said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a
&gt;recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints
&gt;about the conference's 1,700 members.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from
&gt;discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had
&gt;violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with
&gt;sexual conduct.
&gt;
&gt; It is included in the section of the code on "personal
&gt;responsibility," which covers such matters as family life, personal
&gt;honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis "to be scrupulous in
&gt;avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by
&gt;taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves
&gt;or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing
&gt;adults."
&gt;
&gt; Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and
&gt;in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on
&gt;campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before
&gt;becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple
&gt;Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central
&gt;Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has
&gt;four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's
&gt;president.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The
&gt;Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.
&gt;
&gt; Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were
&gt;unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman
&gt;Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent
&gt;replacement.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed "the same process that
&gt;we'd follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar
&gt;circumstances." He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to
&gt;and investigated by the ethics committee. Depending on that
&gt;committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,
&gt;privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or
&gt;expel a rabbi.
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was
&gt;"very difficult and painful for everyone involved."
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
&gt;Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue organization, said
&gt;Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment
&gt;against him but responded to the decision "with great dignity."
&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Yoffie said that during his tenure as president, Rabbi
&gt;Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the
&gt;college's Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining
&gt;rabbis in 2002.
&gt;
&gt; Another member of the conference, Rabbi A. James Rudin, emeritus
&gt;director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish
&gt;Committee, said Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was "a real loss" and
&gt;"a shock to the movement."
&gt;
&gt; Hebrew Union's chairman, Burton Lehman, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as
&gt;"a great, great leader." Mr. Lehman said that Rabbi Zimmerman's
&gt;resignation would "have an impact" but that the college was strong.
&gt;
&gt; "Transitionally, we'll be fine," Mr. Lehman said. "We have a
&gt;strong faculty that will carry this institution through this
&gt;tribulation."

Sorry it's been so long since I could respond. With the craziness here I am 
way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2. volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility. volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days. EOL volume averaging around 14000. 
Very high percent of market. Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior. 
#3. good liquidity first 3 years. okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4. calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day. 70% chance Enron is one side. 
calendar 2009-2013 very rare that it trades.

Subject: EIM Due Diligence: Nymex, Enron Gas Data

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and 
preliminary answers. The answers are attempts by our group, Bob Crane and 
Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you. Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well? I could not find these numbers. These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the 
pulp, paper and steel net works fund. They are in their final stages of due 
diligence and are comparing pulp and paper facts with gas. (They are under a 
confidentiality agreement). 
Please call with any questions
Thank you,

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of "price discovery" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

switching and slowdown in economy. Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance. switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday. gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that. this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days. Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub. unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market. 

funny watching the flies in the front. Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning. probably worth 1.30 now. crazy. people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h. 

what's the thoughts on distillates... is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?</body></mail>

will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt. could j actually

length trying to roll and funds trying to roll at the same time leading to 
some ridiculous level at expiry. any thoughts?

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

A couple of questions
1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season report. There seem to be a lot

the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas. Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery. One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel. They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it. Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

Subject: microphone to houston

John- 

What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as 
possible? We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked 
great. You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without 
getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.

The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. 

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution. I know you and Per have discussed the idea 
of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer. 
I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an 
update of who we are planning to trade with.

Best Rgds,
Caroline

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really 
great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their 
control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could 
have done. I believe you are one of those individuals. I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on. This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months. You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk. I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book. Without you and EOL I could never 
have done what I've done. 

 Thanks,

 Subject: RE: Enron / Avaya meetings: calendar

Larry,

Thank you for getting back with me. To answer your question: It is looking 
more and more like the week of January 8th. The meetings would be held using 
approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window: the 9th, 10th, and 11th. I have 
input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th. 

I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending. For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
meetings. I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
Engineer(s).

I will call you this week to get your input re: who from your team would be 
going, and for which days.

Thank you,

Jeff

Mission/Purpose: Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below. 

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th. If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note. Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail. Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well. Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info. Thank you. 


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: 
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; 
marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip. I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled? I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet. It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. 
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. 
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up 
buying
em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month

fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time 
is
busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with
calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have 
the
time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but
one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called 
impact
of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate 
at
all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.
 also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these
guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash
hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in 
the
back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep
that part of the curve very strong agree?
 be cool my man-talk later

event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent=

executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication=20

would be helpful in this endeavor. Often, this information comes to us=20
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO. =20
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the=

usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes fro=

If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know. Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites. 

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second. Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

John - the FIMAT loan agreeemnt will prohibit ENE from using loan proceeds as 
follows:
No part of the proceeds of any Advance hereunder will be used for 
"purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings 
of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

Do you know whether you engage in purchasing or carrying margin stock? I 
will check with legal as well.

Haven't had the best of months. Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything. Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely. The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing. Something definitely out of whack. Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40. Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. 
Hell, already seeing it in the West. The system is just broken there. 
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. 
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter. the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable. who would have thunk it. Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand. 
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point. continues to be a 
very trending market. most days finish on the intraday high or low. 
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant. i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day. understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow. wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure. very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
 flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

 but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
 guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

43rd should be good. I think you woul dhave had more flavor in Harlem though

I've been tasked with getting tickets to a show. Was it 'Blue Men Group'
that you recommended we see? And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not
as bad as you thought.

Good Afternoon, John!

Thanks for agreeing to be one of the Profile articles in the next issue of 
the ENSIDE. Michelle Vitrella assured me that you would be an interesting 
topic! Our newsletter is set for publication in February and I am setting my 
interview schedule now. I would love to sit down and visit with you for 
about 30 minutes in the early part of December. Please let me know a day and 
time that is convenient for you.

I look forward to hearing from you!

It 
also details one of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data 
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it. I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon). Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion! SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's. You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches. Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame. Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality. Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network. Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

unique deal. An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000. It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4. These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals. 

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts. Unfortunately, the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal. Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals. This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way. I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit. It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities. Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

office.&gt;


&gt; &gt;&gt;The stupidity of some people in this world never fails to amaze me.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; This picture is real - not doctored in anyway - and was taken last
week
&gt; &gt;&gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt; Waldorf, MD by a Transportation Supervisor for a company that
delivers
&gt; &gt;&gt; building materials for 84 Lumber. When he saw it there in the
parking
&gt; &gt;&gt;lot
&gt; &gt;&gt; of IHOP, he went and bought a camera to take pictures.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The car is still running as can be witnessed by the exhaust. A
woman
is
&gt; &gt;&gt; either asleep or otherwise out in the front seat passenger side.
The
&gt; &gt;&gt;guy
&gt; &gt;&gt; driving it was over jogging up and down on Rt. 925 in the
background.
&gt; &gt;&gt;The
&gt; &gt;&gt; witnesses said their physical state was OTHER than normal and the
police
&gt; &gt;&gt; just shook their heads in amazement. The driver finally came back
after
&gt; &gt;&gt; the police were there and was getting down at the back to cut the
'twine
&gt; &gt;&gt; around the load. They told him to get back until it was taken
off.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The materials were loaded at Home Depot. Their store manager said
they
&gt; &gt;&gt; had the customer sign a waiver!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Both back tires are trashed. The back shocks were driven up
through
&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; floorboard. In the back seat are 10 bags, 80 lbs. each of
concrete.
&gt; &gt;&gt; On the roof is many 2X4s, 4X4s and OSB sheets of lumber. They
estimated
&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; load weight at 3000 lbs. The car is a VW Jetta with FL plates
and
the
&gt; &gt;&gt;guy
&gt; &gt;&gt; said he was headed for Annapolis.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;JUST UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
&gt; &gt;&gt;

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela. Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable. She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity. Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource. Thanks for allowing my program her services

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

agreement to "sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or

They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New 
England. They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for 
a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the 
company. After all the bull they agreed to have them shut down and they

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings? We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ. Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week. 

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP &amp; up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities. This would include two primary areas:

1) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use: what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2) EBS &amp; Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served: "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above). In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'. 

Thank you,

Jeff

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all. 
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed. Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0? You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5? From you email yesterday, I was

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you. Just let me

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1) BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2) Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3) BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4) I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works &amp; EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5) So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6) Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions. Period.

7) The Result: EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re: possible fallout around the BMC thing. I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I 
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc. I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against). George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

Here's the latest communication to Bruce Smith regarding Control-SA and
Control-M Windows 2000 certification, as well as reporting on the testing.
It's in the document, but to point it out, Control-SA is ready for
certification process on Dec of 2000 and Control-M on March 2001.

&gt;
&gt; Hi Bruce,
&gt;
&gt; I have attached a document detailing the status of Microsoft
&gt; Certification. We have also summarized our Windows 2000 development and
&gt; certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach. The
&gt; most critical phase, which ensures Win2K compatibility and support and
&gt; includes customer testing, has been completed. The Win2K Agents are GA
&gt; for both Control-M (scheduling) and Control-SA (security).
&gt;
&gt; The next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,
&gt; is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for
&gt; Microsoft Win2K. This phase follows the Win2K initial release as MS
&gt; Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the
&gt; application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the Control-M
&gt; environment.
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of
&gt; the application. It is my understanding that one of the reasons Control-M
&gt; is being considered as a replacement for sys*Admiral is due to the
&gt; problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release.
&gt;
&gt; Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMC's Win2K
&gt; Development Plans. Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with
&gt; an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more
&gt; detail?
&gt;
&gt; One final note. I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves,
&gt; reconfirming that Control-M continues to run smoothly since we made the
&gt; database changes.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week. It seems as we have
&gt; finally got this thing running smoothly. After extending the database and
&gt; troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out
&gt; hearts content.
&gt;
&gt; Please tell Ronnie thanks for all his help as well
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Again
&gt;
&gt; Rusty
&gt;
&gt; As a next step, could we meet soon after the Thanksgiving Holidays? I
&gt; can arrange to bring an executive from product marketing along if you
&gt; would like to discuss Win2K certification in more detail.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Hi Larry,
&gt;
&gt; Following is Ronnie Sapp's summary of the problem resolution for the
&gt; Control-M installation problems and the reliability and scalability
&gt; results
&gt; attained. It now appears that most of the problems were caused by the
&gt; setup
&gt; of the Oracle database.
&gt;
&gt; Once we left Thursday evening and through the following day, Schedule-M
&gt; worked flawlessly. The new day process was last measured taking less
&gt; than
&gt; five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per
&gt; day.
&gt;
&gt; This demonstrates the reliability and scalability of Control-M when
&gt; installed properly. I will give you a call to discuss the results and
&gt; our
&gt; next steps.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rob, will you please forward this to Larry.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Larry, Below is the recap we talked about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Recap:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There were 2 outstanding issues.
&gt; &gt; 1) New Day process running 2-5 hrs.
&gt; &gt; 2) Jobs not running, they were all in Blue or White status.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Issue number 1 was resolved the day before I arrived by Tech Support
&gt; &gt; working with Rusty. Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from 50mg
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; 300mg. Also the log &amp; stat files were extremely small. These files
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; cleaned out by Rusty, however were never increased or set to truncate
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; Oracle. They will fill up again. These files need to be set to
&gt; truncate
&gt; &gt; by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those
&gt; files.
&gt; &gt; We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the
&gt; daily
&gt; &gt; schedule.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Issue number 2 - According to a diagnostic report the agent machine
&gt; lost
&gt; &gt; connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; default settings were set. The agent is set to retry every 120
&gt; seconds up
&gt; &gt; to 12 times. After this period, manual activation is required. I
&gt; signed
&gt; &gt; on as CTMAGENT user and ran ag_menu. Ran option 2 which showed the
&gt; NIS as
&gt; &gt; down. I then signed on as the Control-M user and ran ctm_menu.
&gt; Selected
&gt; &gt; 7 - Agent Status, Selected 2 - List all agent platforms unavailable.
&gt; &gt; Agent on BMC was in unavailable status. Next Selected option 3 -
&gt; Change
&gt; &gt; agent platform to Available status. After doing that, all the jobs
&gt; turned
&gt; &gt; to gray status and started running.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to Control-M/Server.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file
&gt; &gt; (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128) from this file we could tell
&gt; when
&gt; &gt; the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I set up 500 jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies.
&gt; All
&gt; ran
&gt; &gt; ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I set up aprox. another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on
&gt; &gt; OCSDEV-1. They failed due to not using the correct Owner. Rusty
&gt; knows
&gt; &gt; what the correct owner should be. I believed I used CTLM00.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; New Day process ran for approx. 12 mins.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Right before leaving Rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in
&gt; &gt; cleaning out the entire database. Fortunately by design, we were
&gt; able
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; Control-M Server. In less than 5 minutes all was ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I left there were approx. 900 jobs running. Of those approx.
&gt; 400
&gt; &gt; jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes. Which meant on a daily
&gt; basis
&gt; &gt; approx. 14,500 jobs ran per day.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Larry, I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations.
&gt; These
&gt; &gt; is something that's very subjective. As with almost any software the
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; memory and faster CPU the better. To do this correctly, we should
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; environment and the direction your heading. How many jobs per day,
&gt; today,
&gt; &gt; near future, etc.... How many Users of ECS? How many Servers?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; major problem. Your ECS NT box is on the small size, at least in the
&gt; &gt; memory area. So your responses might not be as fast as desired.
&gt; Please
&gt; &gt; remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a
&gt; large
&gt; &gt; number of jobs. Therefore database tuning is always recommended.
&gt; These
&gt; &gt; tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone. There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population. Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops. As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting? It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

John,

I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with 
IE 5.0. Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5. This is an extremely 
important program that all of the traders will be using. If you need 
additional resources, I can arrange for this. Just let me know what you 
need. 

These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version.

Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time. Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday. We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference. However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case. The CDs are not 
included in this figure. 

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

 Subject: Quotes for the CD's.

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's) - $ 355.00
 This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Hi,

If you sent a bank wire on Monday then it should take about 2-3 days to
be credited to your account, but sometimes it takes one or two days
longer. So, if you don't see it today, please give us a call at 888 304
2206 and ask for either Maria or Juliette in the accounts department and
they will assist you.

Thanks,

Hope your interview goes well. Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews. 

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. 
Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. 

The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement 
though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program. That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today? You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program? You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail? I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again. Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process? I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

Subject: Mexico Industrial


&gt; MIHC is a consulting firm with offices in Mexico City and
&gt; Los Angeles. We specialize in assisting foreign national
&gt; corporations with regard to their real estate interest in
&gt; Mexico.
&gt;
&gt; Currently our M,xico City office is representing a client
 regarding the disposition of their surplus corporate assets in
country.
&gt;
&gt; They have three properties which may be might be of
&gt; interest.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Light to Heavy Industrial building in Tula, Hidalgo (a
&gt; well-populated industrial valley roughly 50 miles north of
&gt; Mexico City). Deluxe all brick and concrete building is
&gt; approximately 98,500 square feet with clear span ceiling
&gt; height in excess of 30 ft. The site includes adjacent land,
&gt; which would allow more than doubling the size of facility.
&gt; Located in front of the PEMEX Hidalgo refinery /
&gt; petrochemical plant and a Thermoelectric power generating
&gt; station. Factory is equipment ready and could be in full
&gt; production quickly.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Housing complex built for the Tula factory supervisory
&gt; personnel consists of 32 three-bedroom garden style
&gt; townhouse apartments and an independent eight bedroom
&gt; extended stay dormitory for engineers. In a separately
&gt; enclosed compound is a 3,800 square foot deluxe residence
&gt; with 4-car garage designed for the plant manager or visiting
&gt; officials. The property contains appropriate recreational
&gt; and sports areas for families. It is entirely gated and
&gt; fully secured.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Development site City of Puebla. This highly visible 8.7
&gt; acres of flat land fronts the Puebla-Mexico City
&gt; superhighway at a formal exit. It is at the entrance corner
&gt; to an industrial area of other trans-national manufactures.
&gt; Site is located approximately 5.5 miles north of the
&gt; Volkswagen assembly plant.
&gt;
&gt; Prefer selling items 1 &amp; 2 as a package, but will entertain
&gt; separate offers. Would also consider long term lease with a
&gt; creditworthy corporate tenant.
&gt;
&gt; With respect to item 3, a build to suit, again a
&gt; long-term lease with a credit worthy corporate tenant is
&gt; possible.
&gt;
&gt; All properties are surplus assets and therefore very
&gt; aggressively priced. Factory and housing offered at
&gt; substantially below replacement cost.
&gt;
&gt; For more information on these items and other services we
&gt; provide in Mexico please visit our web site.

Hello

I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in
Houston. We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is
beginning to flow. On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the
signed contract is "on the way".

The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to
provide/supply natural gas to our company. We consume quite a bit of
natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace. I believe last
year we spent about $500,000.

As we both know the price of natural gas is rising. It never hurts to check
and see if better deals are out there. If this is of any interest, please
pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle. The can contact
me first and then I will turn over to our person here. Thanks

game. Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back. No, of course not. But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal. definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is. 
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is. 
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month. i can't remember w/o looking at charts. it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter. i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece. the z/f/g fly is interesting. i think 
z/f can and will settle backw. just a high prob it goes cantango first.
Still seeing sellside interest in term. definitely a result of pira. will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve. previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything. tired of writing us a big check 
every month.
so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night. it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy. they better pay me for the decline 
in my lifestyle .

what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again 
the
numbers but pretty sure they said +3 bcf by dec. ill let you know/its been
along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.
 some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.
 your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.
 fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
 good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.
 by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.

Subject: Video for Enron Management Conference

We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference. We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past. 
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in. We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05. Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days. We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative. Thanks 
for your participation.

I told you I have a long email address.

I've decided what to prepare for dinner tomorrow. I hope you aren't
expecting anything extravagant because my culinary skills haven't been
put to use in a while. My only request is that your stereo works. Music
makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

Watch the debate if you are home tonight. I want a report tomorrow...

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela. Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable. She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity. Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource. Thanks for allowing my program her services 
and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

A couple of issues:

1. I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild). Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2. I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex. Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly. Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm

selling for the first time in two months over the past two days. Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira. Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days. Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas. The spread game is very different than playing crude. 
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup. You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny. 
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1? That seems hard to believe.

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your

Mission/Purpose: Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below. 

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th. If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note. Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail. Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well. Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info. Thank you. 


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: 
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; 
marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip. I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled? I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet. It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle). Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Regards,
Gary

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published? or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends). I assume it is the former, not the 
latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. 
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Good question. The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly 
identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It's 
happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. 
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. 
It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session. Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online? I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

Let me know when will be good for both you and John on next Wednesday
afternoon. Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group.
After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to
add all traders into the NT group, so they can use it.

Hi, Brian:
Let me know if you have time for the messageboard application demo today. I
am planning to take vacation on Friday and coming Monday. I will not be
available to show you the demo until next Wednesday if you can't see it
today.

Let me know your schedule.

I run the structuring group at Azurix, but I am emailing you in reference to 
my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City. Since 
graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New 
York as a local for the last 8 years. He trades natural gas options and is 
looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can 
discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring. If this 
would be of interest or not let me know and I will hook you two up. Thanks 
for your time.

We are still on for drinks on the 19th. You have called the market very well 
since you started sending me updates. Unfortunately for both of us, a couple 
of good calls does not a soothsayer make. Thus, keep sending me your updates 
so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities. In terms 
of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05. Too much 
noise in this market to trade differently for me.

I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before. I
assumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the
19th. We're still on for drinks after work, right? By then, you should
have a comfort level with the quality of my work. I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior. It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market. Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?
That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.
Let me know. Thanks,

John:

The price behavior of the past couple days has been disappointing. My
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price rally and natural
appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is poor,
particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The market
appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If we
are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be
extremely bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so
great. Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture
is still very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of
what I would call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move
to the upside.

Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly don't want to
waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I have something
to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you check/see your

Jeff,

Per our conversation this morning, I will list the items in question. I am
also forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to follow
up on as well.

* ACCOUNTING: Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,
per contract
* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour reception
posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for 40 day
attendees. You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package. However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf. Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room. We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms. Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees. We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees. This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered. The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment. Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions. Thank you for your business!

I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an 
extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box". Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. 
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This 
was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since 
been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. 

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise.

Ode was a bit too idealistic. The campaign in general was very different

Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for 
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.


Thanks

Sean,
The following are the contacts that have been made by Enron Media Services
with Enron Picture. The initial meeting, Enron Media Services was
represented by Mike Horning, Edward Ondarza and Steve Crumley.
We met with the following personnel from SPE:

- Allan Dick, VP Corporate Procurement
- Cherie Crane, SVP Media
- Joseph Foley, SVP Marketing
- Kathleen Shane, VP Finance
- Jennie Angelos, Director Business Planning
- Peter LaBrida, Manager Corporate Procurement

Mike has provided Allan with today's one-year fixed price swap for spot TV
media in NY, LA and Houston. Mike expects feedback from Allan today on the
pricing and the Sony attendees from meeting. The next meeting that Mike is
having is
11/1 with Allan Dick.

Could you do some investigation and find out what the feel is for the Enron
Media Services product offering and possible communicate to Sony Pictures
that there are revenue opportunities for Sony also.

Please give me a call when you have an opportunity.

Jennifer

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested. Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% 
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

 

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%. Does this make sense or is something else happening?

Frank

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company. It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little. Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means. I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday. Never been
but heard it's beautiful. Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean? I'm serious!

So what Fortune article? I only saw you in Time... Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that! What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?! Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny. The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!! I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow. I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday &amp; Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night. No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas. Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri... =) do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Glad to see you're having so much fun with this. I've been here 5.5 years
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time. Pretty funny.
Things are going well here . The big E just chugging along, bringing the
stock price with it. Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but
I think I just did.

Is this "the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives"? If so, you
should write me back after you complete your "nine hours and $1 billion in
trades" today!! Does this mean I have to start calling you "Mr. John"?!
It was great to see you're doing so well....

John, the matrix that was sent to you includes YTD P&amp;L for all the traders in 
the matrix. Trader P&amp;L contribution to desk P&amp;L, however, was not backed out 
on that particular matrix. That matrix effectively shows one trader's 
correlation to all others. What is does not show is one trader's P&amp;L to the 
desk P&amp;L. I have included a spreadsheet with each trader's P&amp;L backed out of 
AGG-GAS P&amp;L to demonstrate their relationship. Please call Frank or myself 
if you have questions. Thanks.

Thx for the spreadsheet. 2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&amp;L. In other words, is my P&amp;L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

John:
?
I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher levels.? I am 
receiving hourly "9" type strength patterns, which means the up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major 
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October 19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,

After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha 
Siegel, we discovered the following:

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics &amp; Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point. Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact? Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest. They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas. 
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

A couple things about the limit orders:

1: When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours. We want the orders open as long as possible. 
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. 
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise. 

2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. 
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000. 

3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,

maybe some for other customers. He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing. This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer. 

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs. </body></mail>

It will be interesting to see what volumes of metal they 
purchase/use...especially steel, given my meeting results from yesterday's 
meeting w/Tim Battaglia and Art Bieser of Enron Industrial Markets (Steel 
Industry origination). Heidi, thank you for helping us out!

I look forward to working with your team on this.

Thank you,

Jeff

It was something for the web-site but we are thinking its a bit arrogant for

please let me know as soon as possible.

The Houston Ballet is located at 1921 W. Bell. The Houston Ballet
Academy faces W. Grey and is inbetween Waugh and Shepherd (next to
Kroger). If you need specific directions please call 713.523.6300. You
