Testing was a critical component of this project.  Initially, tests were performed on each subsystem as they were developed to ensure that each component was working correctly.  For example, when loading in the XML files for phase 1, tests were created to ensure that each file was being parsed properly, and the that the output was being created as expected.  This involved unit tests and manual review.  For phase 2, testing was performed to make sure the process was able to be performed within the time limits listed in the spec, as well as reviewing the indices.  For this phase we also created a program that duplicated the 100k dataset 10 times to produce a test dataset of 1 million emails to ensure the speed of the program was correct.  

For the final phase of the project we created a series of unit tests to ensure that everything was working as expected and to discover any flaws or edge cases that slipped through the implementation of the database system.  This involved reviewing the code, creating case-by-case tests, as well as testing in the program itself and comparing output to what was expected.  Through this we were able to find and eliminate various bugs, and improved the robustness of the program.
